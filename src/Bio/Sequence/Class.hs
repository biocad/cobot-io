--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Type class that describes object that is isomorphisc to 'Sequence'
-- and contains elements of type 'Element', is marked with marking of type
-- 'Marking' and is weighted with weights of type 'Weight'.
--
-- Special cases, when 'IsSequence' has no markings, has no weights, or
-- has no weights and no markings at the same time are aliased:
--  * 'IsWeightedSequence' is alias for sequence with 'Marking' type set to () and 'Weight' not set to ()
--  * 'IsMarkedSequence' is alias for sequence with 'Weight' type set to () and 'Marking' not set to ().
--  * 'IsBareSequence' is alias for sequence with 'Marking' and 'Weight' types
--     set to ().
--
-- Instances of 'IsSequence' can be built only using special constructors:
--  * 'createSequence' creates 'IsSequence' that has 'Marking' and 'Weight'
--    that are not set to ().
--  * 'bareSequence' creates 'IsSequence' that has 'Marking' and 'Weight'
--    that are set to ().
--  * 'weightedSequence' creates 'IsSequence' that has 'Marking' set to () and
--    'Weight' that is not ().
--  * 'markedSequence' creates 'IsSequence' that has 'Weight' set to () and
--    'Marking' that is not ().
--
-- Constraints and constructors mentioned above gaurantee that 'IsSequence'
-- instances that have no 'Weight's will in compile-time
-- have () as types assosiated with their 'Weight's.
-- That is used to make functions that rely on 'IsSequence' instance
-- having not null weights type-safe.
