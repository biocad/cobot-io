-- | Thresholds to clean the data.
-- ABI file contains sequence with quality.
-- By design of sanger sequencing method start and end of the sequence have bad quality.
-- Moreover, internal part of the sequence can also has bad quality.
-- To clean the data we make 2 steps.
--
-- Step 1. Clean edges:
--   * take frame with @frameSize@ and go through the sequence;
--   * on each step evaluate mean value;
--   * if mean value less than @edgeThreshold@, go further;
--   * if mean value more than @edgeThreshold@, stop and cut the sequence from END of this frame;
--   * repeat this algorithm for the right edge.
--
-- Step 2. Evaluate quality:
--   * for cropped sequence evaluate mean value;
--   * if mean value less then @innerThreshold@, sequence is bad;
--   * if mean value more then @innerThreshold@, sequence is acceptable.
--
-- Logic of this algorithm and 'defaultThresholds' were obtained by taking experiments with read ABI files.
